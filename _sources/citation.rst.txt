    NEoST (\url{https://github.com/xpsi-group/neost.git}, \citet{neost})

A paper on NEoST has been submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software and this should (if accepted) eventually be cited as well.

When using NEoST for EOS inference using the chiral EFT + PP/CS extension, please also cite either 
`Raaijmakers et al. (2021) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918L..29R/abstract>`_  or `Greif, Raaijmakers et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.5363G/abstract>`_. 


If you wish to cite published appliations of the NEoST package you can find a list of papers that have used the software via :ref:`publications`.



NEoST also has numerous dependencies that users also benefit from, which should ideally be acknowledged as well.
