To accompany the release of NEoST v1.0 a paper has been submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software and this should (if accepted) eventually be cited as well.

If you wish to cite published appliations of the NEoST package you can find a list of papers that have used the software via :ref:`publications`.

NEoST also has numerous dependencies that users also benefit from, which should ideally be acknowledged as well.
